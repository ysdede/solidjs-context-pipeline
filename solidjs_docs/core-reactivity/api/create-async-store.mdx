The `createAsyncStore` primitive manages asynchronous data fetching by tracking the result of a promise-returning function in a [store](/concepts/stores).

The main difference from [createAsync](/solid-router/reference/data-apis/create-async) is its use of reconciliation: when new data arrives, it intelligently merges with the existing store, updating only changed fields while preserving unchanged state.

## Import

```tsx
import { createAsyncStore } from "@solidjs/router";
```

## Type

```tsx
function createAsyncStore
			</ul>
		
	);
}
```
