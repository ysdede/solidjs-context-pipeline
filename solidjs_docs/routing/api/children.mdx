  Resolve and normalize a component's `children` prop into a stable accessor.
  Useful when you need to read or transform children imperatively inside a
  component.
---

`children` normalizes a component's `children` prop into a stable accessor that returns resolved JSX elements.
It accepts functions, arrays, fragments, and nested structures.

## Import

```ts
import { children } from "solid-js";
```

## Type

```ts
function children(fn: Accessor;
```

### `.toArray()` example

```tsx
function List(props) {
	const resolved = children(() => props.children);
	const items = resolved.toArray();

	return (
		<ul>
			{items.map((child) => (
				<li>{child}</li>
			))}
		</ul>
	);
}

// Usage
;
```

> [!NOTE]
> `children` resolves the current value of `props.children`.
> If `props.children` is reactive, the resolved accessor reflects updates.

### Working with function-as-children

If `children` is a function, the helper evaluates it and returns its rendered result.

```tsx
function Slot(props) {
	const resolved = children(() => props.children);
	return {resolved()};
}

// Usage
;
```
