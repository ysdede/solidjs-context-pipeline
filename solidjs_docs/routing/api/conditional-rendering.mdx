  components for clean, readable conditional logic.
---

Conditional rendering is the process of displaying different UI elements based on certain conditions.
This is a common pattern in UI development, and is often used to show or hide elements based on user input, data, or other conditions.

Solid offers dedicated components to handle conditional rendering in a more straightforward and readable way.

## Show

`
```

`
```

If there are multiple conditions that need to be handled, `
</Show>
```


## Switch and Match

When there are multiple conditions that need to be handled, it can be difficult to manage the logic flow with nested `
  
</Switch>
```

Similar to `
	
</Switch>
```
