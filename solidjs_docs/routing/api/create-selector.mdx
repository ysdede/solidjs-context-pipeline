title: createSelector
use_cases: >-
  selection states, active items, dropdown menus, tab navigation, list
  highlighting, performance optimization
tags:
  - reactivity
  - performance

  - ui-state

version: '1.0'
description: >-
  Optimize selection state with createSelector. Reduce DOM updates from n to 2
  when tracking active items in lists, tabs, or dropdowns.
---

```ts
import { createSelector } from "solid-js"

function createSelector
```

In the code above, each `li` element receives an `active` class
exactly when the corresponding `item.id` is equal to `selectedId()`.
When the `selectedId` signal changes, the `li` element(s) that previously
had previously matching `id` get the `active` class removed, and the 
`li` element(s) that now have a matching `id` get the `active` class added.
All other `li` elements get skipped, so if `id`s are distinct,
only 2 DOM operations get performed.

By contrast, the following code would perform `list().length` DOM operations
every time the `selectedId` signal changes:

```tsx
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = createSignal()


```

| `source` | `() => T`                 | The source signal to get the value from and compare with keys. |
| `fn`     | `(a: U, b: T) => boolean` | A function to compare the key and the value, returning whether they should be treated as equal. Default: `===` |
