`
			</select>
			
		</>
	)
}
```

This example renders a `<select>` element that allows you to choose between three colors.
Once a color is selected, the `
			</select>
			}>
				
				
			</Switch>
		</>
	)
}
```

Instead of a more verbose [`<Switch>` and `<Match>`](/concepts/control-flow/conditional-rendering) statement, `<Dynamic>` offers a more concise way to render components dynamically.

## Props

When working with these components, you can pass [props](/concepts/components/props) to the component you are rendering by passing them to the `<Dynamic>` component.
This makes them available to the component you are rendering, similar to how you would pass props to components in JSX.

```jsx
import { Dynamic } from "solid-js/web"

function App() {
	return (
		
	)
}
```
