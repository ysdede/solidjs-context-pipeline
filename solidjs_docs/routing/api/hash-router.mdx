  HashRouter enables client-side routing using URL hash values, perfect for
  static file hosting where server-side routing isn't available.

The `HashRouter` is a top level component that manages the routing of your application.
It is a client side router that uses hash-values in the URL - providing a single-page application a way to replicate the experience of a multi-page application.

Since hash-routing provides a way for an application to run from a single HTML file, it can be used when hosting on a static file server.

Compared to a browser-router, such as [`Router`](/solid-router/reference/components/router), is that this approach is not SEO friendly.
Because most search engines do not index the hash portion of a URL, they are only able to see the index page of your application when using this approach.

The `root` property is used for components that wrap a matched route and require access to the router context, relevant with navigation components that use [`,
	document.getElementById("app")
);
