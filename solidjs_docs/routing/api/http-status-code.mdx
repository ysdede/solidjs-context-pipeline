`HttpStatusCode` sets the HTTP status code for the page response while server-side rendering.

```tsx
import { HttpStatusCode } from "@solidjs/start";

;
```

## Setting a 404 status code for the unmatched routes

As a page is rendered, you may want to set the status code to the `Response` depending on what happens.
The `HttpStatusCode` component does this for you by taking the `code`  passed in and setting it to the `Response` status in the browser.

Since `HttpStatusCode` is just a component, it can be used with [`ErrorBoundary`](/reference/components/error-boundary), [`Show`](/reference/components/show), [`Switch`](/reference/components/switch-and-match) or any of the other JSX control-flow components. 
This means the same logic used when deciding what to render can inform what status code you are setting, allowing that logic to sit together.

Status codes are important tools for things like caching and SEO, so it is a good practice to send meaningful status codes.
 For example, for a `NotFound` page, you should send a `404` status code.

```tsx {6} title="routes/*404.tsx"
import { HttpStatusCode } from "@solidjs/start";

export default function NotFound() {
	return (
		
			
			<h1>Page not found</h1>
		
	);
}
```

## Setting a 404 status code for missing pages for dynamic routes

When using dynamic params in routes, setting a 404 status code if the given parameter for a segment points to a missing resource is important. 
Usually, the param is discovered to be missing when doing an async request with that parameter. 

Errors can be thrown from inside these fetchers and caught by the nearest [`
			)}
		>
			{house()}
		</ErrorBoundary>
	);
}
```
