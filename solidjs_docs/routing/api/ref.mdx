Refs are a way of getting access to underlying DOM elements in our JSX. While it is true one could just assign an element to a variable, it is more optimal to leave components in the flow of JSX. Refs are assigned at render time but before the elements are connected to the DOM. They come in 2 flavors.

```tsx
// variable assigned directly by ref
let myDiv;

// use onMount or createEffect to read after connected to the DOM
onMount(() => console.log(myDiv));



// Or, callback function (called before connected to the DOM)
 console.log(el)} />
```

Refs can also be used on Components. They still need to be attached on the other side.

```tsx
function MyComp(props) {
	return 
}

function App() {
	let myDiv
	onMount(() => console.log(myDiv.clientWidth))
	return 
}
```
