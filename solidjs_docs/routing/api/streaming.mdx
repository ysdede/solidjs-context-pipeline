title: "Streaming"
---

In traditional server-rendered applications, the server must fetch all data before rendering and sending the page to the browser.
If some queries are slow, this delays the initial load.
**Streaming** solves this by sending the page’s HTML shell immediately and progressively streaming data-dependent sections as they become ready.

When a query is accessed during a server-side render, Solid suspends the UI until the data resolves.
By default, this suspension affects the entire page.

To control this behavior, you can use suspense boundaries - regions of the component tree defined by a [`
			</Suspense>

			
			</Suspense>
		
	);
}
```

For example, each `<Suspense>` component creates its own independent boundary.
The server can stream the heading `<h1>Dashboard</h1>` immediately, while the `stats` and `transactions` are handled separately.
If the `transactions` query is slow, only its boundary will display a fallback, while `stats` will render as soon as its data is ready.

## When to disable streaming

While streaming is powerful, there are cases where it is better to wait for the data to load on the server.
In these situations, you can use the `deferStream` option in `createAsync`.

When `deferStream` is set to `true`, the server waits for the query to resolve before sending the initial HTML.

A common reason to disable streaming is for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
Some search engine crawlers may not wait for streamed content to load.
If critical data, such as a page title or meta description, affects SEO, it should be included in the initial server response.

```tsx
import { query, createAsync } from "@solidjs/router";

const getArticleQuery = query(async () => {
	// ... Fetches an article.
}, "article");

function ArticleHeader() {
	const article = createAsync(() => getArticleQuery(), {
		deferStream: true,
	});

	return <h1>{article()?.title}</h1>;
}
```
