`useResolvedPath` retrieves a signal\<string\>.
It contains the current resolved path as defined in the Route.

```js
const path = useResolvedPath(() => '');

// Parent Route path: /user/* 
console.log(path()); // /user

const path = useResolvedPath(() => 'a/b/c');

// Parent Route path: /user/* 
console.log(path()); // /user/a/b/c

const path = useResolvedPath(() => '/a/b/c'); // Note: /

// Parent Route path: /user/* 
console.log(path()); // a/b/c
```

Useful for making modular routers

```js
const parentRoutePath = useResolvedPath(() => '');

return <>
        <h1>Module component layer</h1>
        
</>
```
