The `useSubmissions` primitive returns the state of all submissions for a given [action](/solid-router/concepts/actions).

## Import

```tsx
import { useSubmissions } from "@solidjs/router";
```

## Type

```tsx
function useSubmissions
						
						
					
				)}
			</For>
		
	);
}
```

### Filtering submissions

```tsx
import { useSubmissions } from "@solidjs/router";

const addTodoAction = action(async (formData: FormData) => {
	// ... Sends the todo data to the server.
}, "addTodo");

function FailedTodos() {
	const failedSubmissions = useSubmissions(
		addTodoAction,
		([formData]: [FormData]) => {
			// Filters for submissions that failed a client-side validation
			const name = formData.get("name")?.toString() ?? "";
			return name.length <= 2;
		}
	);

	return (
		
			<p>Failed submissions:</p>
			
		
	);
}
```
