  Migrate your Solid Router application to v0.10 with this comprehensive guide
  covering removed APIs, new patterns, and Islands support changes.
---

v0.10.0 brings some big changes to support the future of routing including Islands/Partial Hydration hybrid solutions.
Most notably there is no Context API available in non-hydrating parts of the application.

The biggest changes are around _removed APIs_ that need to be replaced.

## `;
```

And then in your component taking the page props and putting them in a Context.

```js
import { createContext, useContext } from "solid-js";

const UserContext = createContext();

function User(props) {
	<UserContext.Provider value={props.data()}>
		{/* my component content that includes  in any depth  */}
	</UserContext.Provider>;
}

function UserDetails() {
	const user = useContext(UserContext);
	// render stuff
}
```
