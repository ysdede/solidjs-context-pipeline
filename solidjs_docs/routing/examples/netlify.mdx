[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a widely-used hosting platform suitable for various types of projects.
For detailed guidance on build procedures, deployment options, and the range of features available, you can visit the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/).

## Using the Netlify web interface

1. Begin by navigating to [Netlify's website](https://app.netlify.com/) and logging in or creating a new Netlify.
   Once logged in, you will be take to your dashboard. Click the `New site from Git` button to start a new project.



2.  On the following page, choose "Connect to GitHub" or your preferred Git repository hosting service.



3. After selecting your Solid project repository, you'll be directed to a configuration screen.
   Update the "Publish directory" field from `netlify` to `dist`. Then, click "Deploy" to start the deployment process.



4. Once the build and deployment are complete, you will be taken to a screen that displays the URL of your live site.

## Using the Netlify CLI

1. Install the Netlify CLI using your preferred package manager:

```package-install-global
netlify-cli
```

**Note:**
Before proceeding, ensure that your Netlify account and team are fully set up.
This is crucial for a seamless project setup and deployment.

2. Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the `netlify init` command.
   Authenticate using one of the supported login options.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions from the CLI. When prompted for the 'Directory to deploy,' specify `dist` — this is where Solid stores the built project files.

After completing the process, your project will be deployed on Netlify and can be accessed via the provided URL.
