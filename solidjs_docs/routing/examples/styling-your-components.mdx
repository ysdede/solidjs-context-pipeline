Solid provides flexible and versatile ways to style your components.
[`class` and `style` bindings](/concepts/components/class-style) can both be added to dynamically style components with plain CSS.
Solid also supports a range of styling methods - from traditional CSS preprocessors to modern CSS-in-JS solutions - ensuring the flexibility to choose the best approach for your projects.

## CSS preprocessors








SASS
LESS

## CSS modules



## CSS-in-JS

CSS-in-JS is a modern approach to styling components.
Within the [Solid ecosystem](https://www.solidjs.com/ecosystem), there are various libraries and solutions available for working with CSS-in-JS, including but not limited to:

- [Solid Styled Components](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-styled-components)
- [Solid Styled JSX](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-styled-jsx)

CSS-in-JS libraries often come with their own set of APIs and methods for defining, updating, and applying styles dynamically.
Many also offer features like theming, media queries, and server-side rendering support right out of the box.

**Note:** Before choosing a CSS-in-JS library, it is recommended to check its compatibility with Solid.
