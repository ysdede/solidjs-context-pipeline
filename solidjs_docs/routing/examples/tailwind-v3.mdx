[Tailwind CSS v3](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/) is an on-demand utility CSS library that integrates seamlessly with Solid as a built-in PostCSS plugin.

## Installation

1. Install Tailwind CSS as a development dependency:


```package-install-dev
tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
```

2. Next, run the init command to generate both `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.

```package-exec
tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Since Tailwind CSS is configuration-driven, after initializing, a `tailwind.config.js` file will be created at the root of your project directory:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
	theme: {
		extend: {},
	},
	plugins: [],
};
```

For a deeper dive into configuration, you can check out the [Tailwind Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

## Add Tailwind directives

In your `src/index.css` file, add the following Tailwind directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives inform PostCSS that you're using Tailwind and establish the order of the directives. You can append custom CSS below these directives.

## Import Tailwind CSS

Import your `index.css` file into the root `index.jsx` or `index.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web"
import App from "./App"
import "./index.css"

render(() => , document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
```

## Usage

With Tailwind CSS set up, you can now utilize its utility classes.
For instance, if you previously had a `Card.css` file, you can replace or remove it:

```
/* src/components/Card.css */
/* Remove or replace these styles with Tailwind utility classes */
```

Update your components to use Tailwind's utility classes:

```jsx
/* src/components/Card.jsx */
function Card() {
	return (
		
			
				Hello, world!
			
		
	);
}
```
